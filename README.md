LeanArch
========
Here is a set of scripts I use to setup Arch Linux as a full-featured and productive desktop.

## Assumptions / Prerequisites
* Arch Linux is installed. The [Arch Ultimate Install Script](https://github.com/helmuthdu/aui) will help you install what you need (Xorg+DE, Apps, codecs etc...)
* Desktop environement or window manager + display manager is installed and starts up

Additional prerequisite for specific scripts are specified in the beginning of their file.
I write new configuration scripts as I experiment with different tweaks in my setups (e.g. different window managers). Some the scripts 
please take a look at the prerequisites for each scripts in case you're not sure what you can combine.

## Things covered by the scripts
[In Progress] Openbox Production Environement (OPE): switchable keyboard layouts, tint2, gmrun or synapse, theming .
[Backlog] Awesome production environement (APE): switchable keyboard layouts, tint2, gmrun or synapse, .
[Backlog] Xmonad production environmement (XPE)
[Backlog] Combine XFCE4 with OPE, APE or XPE
[Backlog] Vim + Janus


## Contributing
Please feel free to send pull requests with your own tweaks to the scripts. Edit the scripts with better defaults or use comments for more subjective configuration choices.

I develop and maintain LeanArch as a hobby. If it made your day, don't hesitate to share the love.
